Hi there! I'm an urban designer & planner with skills in city planning, architecture, and product design. I hold a Master of City Planning degree and an Integrated Product Design certificate from University of Pennsylvania. 

With a global perspective and dedication to interdisciplinary study, I participated in a broad range of professional projects in both the US and China, including downtown revitalization, historic preservation, new town design & planning, architectural design, and interior consultancy. 

As a futuristic urbanist, I'm passionate about creating vibrant places that can benefit local communities, and I'm seeking for innovative toolkits to maximize the impact of design. Envisioning the future, I'll continue to explore the intersection of design technology, climate resiliency, and most importantly - public life.
