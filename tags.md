I love traveling & flying. Being an urban designer gives me more opportunities to visit different cities, and learn more about their residents, culture & built-environment. Other than that, Iâ€™m also an amateur soccer, basketball, badminton & piano player. 

In recent years, I've spent most of my time in Philadelphia, US & Guangzhou, CN. No matter where you're from, I'd like to hear from you! My contact information is at the bottom left corner.
