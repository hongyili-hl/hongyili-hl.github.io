The Macon Action Plan (MAP) is a comprehensive, community-driven plan that envisions the future of Maconâ€™s Urban Core. The "Urban Core" is the heart of Macon, and refers to Downtown Macon and nearby neighborhoods. It is where the City was first established, and remains a center of employment, entertainment, education and healthcare, as well as home to a collection of historic and diverse neighborhoods and communities. 

MAP XL in 2024 is about managing opportunities and sustaining momentum Downtown has truly transformed over the years since the first MAP. There are more people, businesses, housing and things to do. It is time to think about how to maintain what makes Macon different and unique, support and strengthen the gains made over the years through governance and maintenance, and take it to the next level.
