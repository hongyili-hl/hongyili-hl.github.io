*Project at Interface Studio*

This plan aims to transform the Robert T. Wolfe Apartments and surrounding “Union Square” community. Robert T. Wolfe is a 92-unit, low-income, public housing high rise located adjacent to the Union Station Train Station, New Haven Police Headquarters and the former site of Church St. South housing development in need of significant redevelopment to meet the needs of its residents.

The vision for the site is one of innovation, opportunity, and community empowerment. Through a comprehensive redevelopment plan, Glendower will aim to follow HUD’s three-pronged “Housing, People and Neighborhood” approach by:

- Gathering data at the resident and neighborhood level by holding resident, community & stakeholder engagement charrettes to assure that residents and other stakeholders are meaningfully engaged in the planning and implementation process
- Developing a plan for housing design, neighborhood improvements and employment, education and health care programs
- Embarking on initiatives for Beautification, Community Arts, Fresh Food access and Homeowner/Business Façade enhancement programs
