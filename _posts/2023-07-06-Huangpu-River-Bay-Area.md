*Project at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill*

Located at the intersection of three rivers in south Shanghai, the goal of this project is to provide a paradigm of eco-friendly development. Currently, the study area is surrounded by high tech factories, industrialized land and suburb park. It's a mix of urban and nature. In the future, all the existing industrial & agricultural land will be converted into a new satellite city, which includes a combination of living, innovation, recreation, tourism and culture programmings. When the construction is completed, the bay area wil become a new destination for citizens of all ages.

Another important aspect of the project is landscape restoration. The existing concrete leeve in the study area is lack of permeablity. The guts and streams are severely polluted and disconnected. Therefore, we aim to provide a natural waterfront experience and promote biodiversity with necessary design intervention and landscape restoration.
