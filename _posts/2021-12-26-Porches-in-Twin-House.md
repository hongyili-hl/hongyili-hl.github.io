In Tokyo, most people are suffering from the overwhelming social and working pressure, isolating them from realizing their instinct and sensations. Moreover, fast-paced daily routine and major setbacks in life are the main causes of social withdrawal, which keeps people away from nature and society. 

In the project of twin house, I propose four types of porches as a series of in-between spaces, so they could form flexible space between different indoor functions and outdoor boundaries. In this way, the twin house might provide more possibilities for interaction between indoor residents and the outer world. Enlightened by Zen Buddhism, I consider the conditions of the adjacent space next to these porches, in which some philosophy elements could be emphasized to strengthen people's sensations of different ambiences. As a result, real perception might help residents awaken their feelings, even bring them closer to nature and the real world.
