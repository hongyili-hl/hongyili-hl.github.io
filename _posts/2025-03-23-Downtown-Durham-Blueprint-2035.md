Downtown Durham has seen incredible growth and change since the last master plan was established 23 years ago. To meet this progress and adapt to new challenges, DDI has launched the Downtown Durham Blueprint: 2035. This new plan aims to preserve downtownâ€™s unique character while supporting continued growth and development.

The final plan will be revealed to public in the coming weeks!
