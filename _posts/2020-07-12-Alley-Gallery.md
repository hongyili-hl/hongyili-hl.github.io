In the old town of Guangzhou, market culture and public life are the main characters in the alleys, many traditional lifestyles take root in this space. However, as the old buildings begin to deteriorate, and the supervision of folk markets becomes stricter, many residents and vendors moved out of the old town in the last decade, which made the feelings of traditional alleys continue to disappear.
 
In this project, the site is located at an important node of local public space, which is back to traditional alleys and faces the river. To reappear traditional feelings, I extract the scales and modules of local alleys, then combine them with abstract architecture prototypes. As a result, alleys and corridors run through the gallery within flexible exhibition space. Besides, due to the complicated site condition, two diagonal axis grids are applied to accustom the architecture with its surroundings, so several courtyards are produced to accommodate different grids in the gallery.
