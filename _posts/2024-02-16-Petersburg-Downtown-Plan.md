The Petersburg Downtown Plan is the result of a community-driven process that unfolded over the course of 2023. Looking ahead to 2040, the plan will guide the next 15 plus years of growth and change, development and preservation within Downtown and the Downtown community.

Developed during the same time frame as the City’s new Comprehensive Plan, this district-specific plan for Petersburg’s historic urban core is an opportunity to demonstrate how the ideas and overarching direction of the Comprehensive Plan touch the ground in Downtown, at once the central business district, a walkable neighborhood, a hub of community, and a destination for visitors who travel from near and far. Serving a range of diverse functions and a diverse community, the Petersburg Downtown Plan grapples with a range of important issues from economic development and housing to design and preservation; history and narrative; walkability, sustainability, and inclusivity; parking, parks, and programming.
