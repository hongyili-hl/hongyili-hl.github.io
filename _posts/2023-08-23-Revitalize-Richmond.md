*Project at Interface Studio*

Revitalize Richmond includes three areas of focus: Activate, Build, and Connect. The projects in these areas are mutually beneficial to Earlham and the neighbors in Wayne County and include the development of new urban housing in downtown Richmond, improved transit connecting Earlhamâ€™s campus to downtown, new outdoor recreation opportunities in the Whitewater Valley Gorge and other quality-of-place improvements to help Earlham and Richmond grow together.
