This project studies the Wenchong Shipyard, which will be demolished in the Economic Development Zone of Guangzhou. Even though the former industrial area contains a few under-utilized port facilities and valuable industrial remnants, it is also polluted by different kinds of contamination. Hence, the potential of the waterfront area is crippled in future planning blueprint. 

Considering the housing shortage in the district, we propose a progressive developing strategy under the law of conserving specific industrial remnants. As the ecological restoration goes on, different types of land will serve for hybridized housing programs in the new community. With a comprehensive waterfront renovation, the riverbank could be more resilient and provide better eco-friendly space for dwellers. In the city's scale, by reshaping the environment of former marine industrial areas, the mixed-use riverfront corridor would not only raise surrounding land values, but also become a new economic generator for the next decade.
