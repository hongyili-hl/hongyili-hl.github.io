Smart Parking Philadelphia is a low-cost project that detects and visualizes the availability of street parking. Nowadays, it’s hard to find a parking space in downtown Philadelphia, especially during peak hours, which leads to more congestion, carbon emission and traffic accidents in Center City. By connecting the existing underground inductive loops to a new sensors system, the program aims to show real-time parking availability at most intersections via affordable implementation process. 

We completed the prototype with Arduino sensors. For instance, the inflow section consists of four parts:

* Power supply, which is shared with the signal light.
* Inductive loops, for calculating vehicle inflow.
* Communication module. In the inflow section, it’s the signal receiver that can receive data from the outflow section wirelessly.
* Signal Board. We use LED matrix to visualize parking availability to drivers.

Similarly, the outflow section consists of power supply, inductive loops, and communication module (signal transmitter).
