In rural areas of Xinjiang, the labor-intensive farming industry is the cornerstone of the local economy; most everyday activities are related to the farming process. However, the importance of inheriting traditional lifestyles and conserving local society were often overlooked during rural planning. As a result, old settlements declined when people emigrated from their former villages to new towns.

In this project, I propose a model of new urban morphology, together with progressive revival strategies. Based on the existing rural texture, farming places would be closely connected to residential zones on the overlapped stripes, where villagers could carry on diverse public interactions as well as farming activities simultaneously. Besides, future expansion and economic resurgence are also considered. By providing progressive development guidelines for the village, including industrial regeneration and educational incubation, the short-term investment could receive positive long-term feedback after several steps. Finally, the village would establish a self-sufficient system, and residents could experience a modern living pattern in the place they call “home”.
