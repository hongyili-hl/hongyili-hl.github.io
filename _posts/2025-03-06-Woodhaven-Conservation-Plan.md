The Woodhaven Neighborhood Conservation Plan is the result of a collaborative effort that unfolded over the course of 2024. The purpose of the plan is to provide a roadmap for investment, preservation, and growth in Fort Worth’s Woodhaven neighborhood over the next 15 years.

The Woodhaven Neighborhood Conservation Plan is structured around five goals:

- Health & Wellbeing: Young at Heart in Woodhaven

- Environment: Surrounded by Nature in Woodhaven

- Economic Opportunity: Work & Prosper in Woodhaven

- Housing: Quality Homes and Amenities in Woodhaven

- Implementation: Making it Happen in Woodhaven 
 
Each goal has its own chapter that shares data and community input on why the topic matters for the future of Woodhaven, lists specific objectives that describe what Woodhaven aims to accomplish with each goal, and provides detailed recommendations for investments that respond to Woodhaven’s unique needs and opportunities.
